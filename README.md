2019-08-12 18:02:21 WARNING: The delays in the connector AllToAllConnector from outputspikes to outputspikes was clipped to 1.0 a total of 72 times.  This can be avoided by reducing the timestep or increasing the minimum delay to one timestep
2019-08-12 18:02:21 WARNING: No multicast packets were sent by supersignal:0:8.  If you expected packets to be sent this could indicate an error
2019-08-12 18:02:21 WARNING: The reinjector on 0, 0 has detected that 25 packets were dumped from a core failing to take the packet. This often occurs when the executable has crashed or has not been given a multicast packet callback. It can also result from the core taking too long to process each packet. These packets were reinjected and so this number is likely a overestimate.
